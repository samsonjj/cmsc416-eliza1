# cmsc416-eliza1

This program imitates a psychotherapist, following in the footsteps of the [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) program developed in the 1960's by Joseph Weizenbaum. The program uses cheap tricks to carry out the impersonation, little intellijence or learning of machinery is actually involved.

The program exists as a perl script, and can be run using the command 

```
$ perl elizajjs.pl
```
